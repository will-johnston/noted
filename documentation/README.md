# Documentation
Here lies shared documentation between the two codebases. Ideally, each project should maintain documentation about itself so that others can more easily adapt to the codebase. In the interest of coordination, and generally not mucking things up, here is some documentation that affects both codebases. Links to codebase specific documentation is also included if you're truly lost.
