# Components
This is the current list of all Components including: what they do, why are they a thing, systems they're a part of, etc.

## Login
This is the login page where logging in will occur. It is the first page of the application.

## Homescreen
This is the homescreen page where all the notes will be (similar to the 'filesystem'). It is navigated to next from the login page.

### Design
The plan is to have a grid of notes (not the Note component, but like a note-detail component or something) that when clicked will navigate to a Note with the relevant info. This page should include the ability to create, delete, and share notes.

## Note
This page contains the note editor as well as anything specific to note playback or viewing the original picture.
