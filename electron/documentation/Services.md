# Services
This is a collection of common services for general usage. Some API functions may not be implemented yet and should be documented as such (TBI).

## File System
This service is a genuine mess and should be reworked altogether, so I'm not going to spend time documenting it. This is Ryan's monstrosity, just let him patch the pieces up.

## Notifications
This service is responsible for sending and destroying notifications (TBI). It does not handling retrieving notifications (see [Note](/electron/documentation/RetrievingNotifications.md)).
### API
- notify()

Sends a notification to a user with a given Notifications.Notif object.
- clearNotification() (TBI)

Deletes a notification from a user.
### Types
- Notifications.Notif

Represents a notification stored in the database. Should be used for creating notifications to be sent as well. 

  #### Methods
  ShareNoteNotification() : Creates a new notification for sharing notes. The created notification is then sent by NotificationsService.notify()
  
  Ex: `Sally has shared 'prisoners' with you`

## Sharing
This service is responsible for sharing notes, deleting shared notes (TBI), and getting users who have been shared the note
### API
- getSharedUsers()

Gets all the users that have been shared a given note.
- shareNote()

## UserList
This service is responsible for registering, searching for, and getting users from the userList database object.
### API
- register()

Registers a user to the userList if they are not already on the list.
- search()

Searches for userInfo based on given criteria. ([IMPORTANT NOTE](/electron/documentation/NullDisplayName.md))
Ex: `search 'ryaneverett33@outlook.com' -> UserList.User(email, name, userID)`
As of time of writing, any searches based on name will fail.
- get()

Gets user info given the userID.
### Types
- UserList.User

Not to be confused with firebase.User!! This type represents a stored user info in the userList object.

## DarkMode
This service is responsible for handling global colors with respect to a dark mode and a light mode. 

### API
- Toggle()

Changes the current color mode from light to dark or dark to light. Updates the stylesheets automatically.
